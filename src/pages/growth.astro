                Marketing isn't an expense—it's math. See what happens when you
                treat paid media as an integrated system rather than just ad
                buying.

            <h3>How this works</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout my career—from startups to Fortune 500 brands like
                Hyundai—I’ve averaged a <strong>30% improvement</strong> in campaign
                efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>This isn't magic. It comes from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Triangulating Data:</strong> Connecting ad platforms to
                    CRM outcomes (signed deals), not just clicks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Funnel Mechanics:</strong> Reducing friction in the intake
                    process to improve conversion rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Negative Logic:</strong> Aggressively filtering "junk"
                    spend (low intent, wrong geography).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When you fix the leaks, the same budget drives significantly
                more revenue. That is the leverage of a true Growth Director.
