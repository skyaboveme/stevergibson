                    I have spent my career leading paid media strategy,
                    execution, and optimization across search, social,
                    programmatic, and video. My experience spans both brand and
                    performance objectives with budgets ranging from high-growth
                    venture accounts to multi-million dollar national media.

                    I have planned and bought across Google Ads (Search, PMax,
                    YouTube, Display), Meta (Facebook and Instagram), DV360 and
                    programmatic platforms, as well as connected TV, OTT, Print,
                    OOH media, and radio. On several accounts I owned the full
                    funnel including creative testing, landing page improvement,
                    analytics, attribution, CRM integration, and pacing.

                    Greatest Strengths
                </h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                    My strengths are strategy, execution, and systems. I can
                    build a paid media plan from zero, set up the measurement
                    framework, execute in-platform, iterate creative, and close
                    the loop with sales or CRM data. I am comfortable owning
                    both the planning and the buying and I tend to push for
                    clarity around expected outcomes instead of just channel
                    activity.

                    class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mt-4"
                >
                    I also bring a strong blend of analytical and creative
                    thinking. I enjoy audience development, positioning, and
                    content, but I’m equally comfortable in pacing sheets,
                    attribution reports, and forecasting. Lastly, I am reliable
                    under pressure and good at simplifying complex decisions for
                    stakeholders.

                    Achilles Heel
                </h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                    I get impatient when goals are unclear or when teams are
                    operating without defined outcomes. I enjoy moving fast and
                    iterating toward measurable results, so I tend to push for
                    alignment on success metrics early in a project. Like right
                    away. I’ve learned to manage this by pausing to get context,
                    asking clarifying questions, and helping turn ambiguity into
                    something the team can execute against.

                </h2>
                <p class="text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
                    In the next year I want to deepen my strategic impact in
                    paid media by owning more full-funnel plans with clear
                    performance outcomes, and by pushing more disciplined
                    measurement (offline conversion imports, attribution, and
                    CRM-connected reporting). I want to continue leveling up in
                    creative testing and audience development, particularly in
                    environments where content velocity and iteration drive
                    scale. I also want to contribute more to thought leadership
                    and knowledge sharing internally so that the team benefits
                    from what works instead of reinventing the wheel each time.
                    Finally, I am fully embracing the power of AI to automate
                    routine optimization and act as a force multiplier for
                    strategy.

                    I thrive in teams that operate with clear goals, open

                    enjoy working with people who bring different strengths to

                    iteration, and data-informed decision making. I am at my
                    best in environments where people take ownership,
                    collaborate across functions, and care about the work being
                    effective rather than just busy. A healthy dose of humor and
                    optimism also goes a long way.
