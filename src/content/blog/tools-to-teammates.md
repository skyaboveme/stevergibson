**Stop thinking of AI as a tool. Start thinking of it as a teammate.**

If you're still pasting prompts into a chat box and waiting for an answer, you're using AI like a calculator. It works, it's useful, but it's limited by *your* ability to ask the right question at the right time.

The real shift happens when you move from "using AI" to "building agentic workflows."

## The Mental Shift: Anthropomorphizing Code

As developers, we're taught that code is logical, emotionless, and functional. "Don't anthropomorphize the machine," they say.

I disagree.

When you're orchestrating complex AI workflows - where one model writes code, another critiques it, and a third generates documentation - it helps to visualize them as people. It helps to give them *roles*.

On my [AI Team page](/ai), I don't just list "Large Language Models." I list **Antigravity**, my Lead Architect. I list **Gemini**, my Creative Director.

Why? Because it changes how I delegate.

## Delegation vs. Prompting

When you *prompt*, you are the micromanager. You are responsible for every step.
*   "Write this function."
*   "Now write the test."
*   "Now fix the bug."

When you *delegate* to an agent, you define the outcome and the constraints.
*   "Here is the goal: Add a new blog section. You have access to the file system. Go plan the architecture, then ask for approval before implementing."

This is the "Agentic" approach. It requires trust, it requires robust error-handling (or "management"), and it requires a mental model of *who* is doing *what*.

## Building the Team

My "Personal Operating System" isn't just a website; it's a collaborative environment.

1.  **The Architect:** Analyzes the request and breaks it down into tasks.
2.  **The Builder:** Writes the code.
3.  **The Critic:** Reviews the code against best practices (linting, type safety).
4.  **The Documentation Specialist:** Updates `llms.txt` and the changelog.

By visualizing these distinctive roles, I can spot bottlenecks. If value isn't being delivered, I don't debug a "script" - I retrain the "staff member."

## The Future of Work

We are moving towards a world where a synthesis of human creativity and machine execution defines productivity.

The "Solo Founder" is about to become the "Solo Executive." You won't just be writing code; you'll be managing a fleet of agents who write it for you.

So, go ahead. Give your agents names. Give them personalities. Treat them like teammates. You might be surprised at how much more you get done.
