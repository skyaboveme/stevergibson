In that time, I’ve been able to strengthen my knowledge of paid search strategy. Not only does he know the best practices to optimize and improve account performance, he is also quick to formulate new strategies that utilize new features any of the engines introduce. His years of experience in the industry have given him a wealth of knowledge that he is more than happy to share with his colleagues.",

Steve is a highly experienced marketer with a strong understanding of the power of Search and analytics. Steve can turn a not so exciting conversation about Search into an intriguing story and draw you in. His company-wide presentation of search media was what ultimately lead me to leave display and join the Kia Search team. He is constantly working to find creative solutions to complex problems.',
